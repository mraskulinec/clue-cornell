# Clue Cornell (milestone #3)
## CS 3110 Final Project
### Maria Raskulinec, Jiarui Hu, Mihika Jain

## Vision
Our vision for our final project has not really changed. Just as in our previous sprints, we see a multiplayer game of Clue that is run through the terminal. In this sprint specifically, we focused on making our game fully functional and usable from a front-end perspective. We wanted our game to be user-friendly including a welcome screen with instructions. The players can then input their number of players, and they are assigned a game character and are dealt randomized hands of cards. All of this information that is computer generated is printed in the terminal, and then the game will begin. On each turn, the user has the option to guess, accuse, use the help function, move rooms, end the game, or switch to the next player. Additionally, on each turn the user can see all of their cards, and where they are on a board that is color-coded based on what room the user is in. 

## Summary of Progress
As a team, we have made an immense amount of progress through MS3. We implemented the multiplayer aspect of our game and reformatted how we were thinking about the different game states. We were able to finish implementing the start of the game (the dealing of hands, and assignment of players) we then showcased these changes in our user interface, making the front end of our game much more user-friendly. To do this, we made sure to print the user’s board, hand, and location at the beginning of the game and then again every time it was their turn. 
To complement this, we fleshed out the backend of our code building on the structure we reformatted in MS2. We fully implemented all of the functions that a user can make on their turn that we hadn’t yet begun, and finished and changed all of the other functions that we had begun. These included but were not limited to, switching rooms, accusing someone, ending the game, and guessing on each turn. In our demo, we made sure to show off all of these new functionalities through our developed user-friendly interface.

Progress Report

## Productivity Analysis
We would say that we were extremely productive this sprint. We were able to accomplish almost everything that we wanted to for good scope making the game almost entirely functional. We worked really hard on making sure that we were all working together, and keeping ourselves on track to be done with the project on time. This was very good news for us because we haven’t been able to accomplish what we thought we could for the last two sprints due to unforeseen issues and complications, however, we were able to this time because we put in more time, and got through the issues, allowing us to keep working. 
We really pushed through to the finish line for MS3, now understanding why CS 3110 — the final project, specifically — is thought of as a marathon, not a sprint. Though we restructured and redesigned our game multiple times, on this last leg of the project, everything came together because we had already learned from each other and our own mistakes. We were able to incorporate old versions of our project into new, better structures, which was very rewarding and didn’t make it feel like all our previous time had been wasted. 

## Scope Grade
We have decided to give ourselves a grade of good scope for this sprint. We have given ourselves because of all of the things mentioned earlier in this report. We were very productive, and fully implemented the game exactly how we planned to in good scope for our last sprint. We definitely went beyond satisfactory scope in how much we accomplished; however, we could possibly have made our code and game more complex to reach excellent scope. For example, our game’s multiplayer status, full functionality, and user-friendliness show that we worked on the front and backend tirelessly to improve the project from where it was in MS2. However, we did not implement the dice roll, or the secret passageways which were extra elements of our game that we may have implemented to reach a grade of excellent scope. Overall, we are really proud of our project and the system that we have created.
